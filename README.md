# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Brendan O'Connor

## Overview.

This is a react app that uses the tmdb api to display details of movies and actors in various forms.

### Features.
 
+ Watchlist Page and Icons
+ Top Rated Movies page
+ Movie Cast List page
+ Actor Details page

## Setup requirements.

I do not believe there are any non standard setup requirements.

## API endpoints.

+ Top Rated Movies - movie/top_rated
+ Movie Credits list - movie/:id/credits
+ Actor details - person/:id
+ Actor images - person/:id/images

## Routing.

+ movies/watchlist - Display the user's watchlist
+ movies/toprated - View a list of top rated Movies
+ cast/:id - View the cast of a specific movie
+ actors/:id - Display the details on a specific actor

## Independent learning (If relevant).

I used the tmdb website to find the appropriate end points ass well as the structure of responses, such as what fields are a part of "credits" and "people" (i.e. name, biography, etc).
